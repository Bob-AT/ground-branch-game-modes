**Elevator pitch**
E.g.: Co-op game mode, player team has to find, eliminate and confirm elimination of a high value target, and then extract from the area of operation.

**Gameplay loop**
1. Start in ready room and prepare for mission
2. Ready up and spawn at selected insertion points
3. Search for the HVTs
4. Eliminate HVTs
5. Confirm elimination of HVT
6. Extract entire team via extraction point

**Additional notes**
Add any other notes regarding the game mode.
