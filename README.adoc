Note: Right now this project uses *gb-tools*, and game modes manifests (the _*.gbm_ files), for packaging game modes into zip archives. More details about the *gb-tools* and manifests can be found on the https://github.com/gbgmc/gb-tools[*gb-tools* github page]. This will be replaced with a shell script that copies to "`Documents/StagedMod`" soon.
