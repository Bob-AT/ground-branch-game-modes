title: Break Out
---

The _Break Out_ game mode tasks you, and your team, to escape from a dangerous situation.

**Type:** Solo, Coop, PvE.\
**Players:** 1-8.

## Objectives

- **Primary**
    - Exfiltrate via the extraction point.
- **Secondary**
    - Keep the entire team alive.

## Settings

* **Expected resistance** - impacts the amount of enemies that will spawn in mission. 
The final Opposing Force count takes player count and this setting into account. 
* **Respawn Cost** - the score value that is required for a respawn. Setting this value
to 0 will basically allow for infinite respawns from the get-go, while setting it to
10000 will make it almost impossible to get at least one respawn.
* **Display Objective Messages** - whether objective messages should be displayed.
* **Display Objective Prompts** - whether objective world prompts should be displayed.
* **Display Score Messages** - whether score messages should be displayed.
* **Display Score Milestone Messages** - whether score milestone messages should be displayed.

## How to respawn

There are two ways to respawn:

1. If your team achieved or surpassed the score necessary for a respawn before you
died, then you can respawn using the 'Respawn' option from the 'Out of Action' death
screen.
2. Otherwise, or if you miss-clicked, you can respawn from the Ready Room as long as
the round is In Progress. To do so, walk up to the Laptop placed on the desk next to
the operation board and use it.

If somehow you ended up in the Spectating mode, press <kbd>F4</kbd> to go to the Ready Room.

Note: For the time being if you respawn from the Ready Room you will not be shown
on the after action report.
