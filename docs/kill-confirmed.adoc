== Kill Confirmed

In _Kill Confirmed_ you need to locate, neutralize and confirm elimination of all _HVTs_ (High Value Targets) in the AO (area of operation).

*Type:* Solo, Coop, PvE.

*Players:* 1-8.

=== Objectives

* *Primary*
** Find and neutralize all HVTs,
** Confirm each HVT kill,
** Extract via exfil point.
* *Secondary*
** Avoid collateral damage. (Only in _Semi-Permissive_ variant)

*Note:* Due to the fact that the game stops tracking AI character the moment the AI is neutralized the kill is confirmed by walking over the place where the AI died, not where it’s body is.

*Variations:*

. _Security Detail_: Everyone is a combatant.
. _Security Detail (Semi-Permissive)_: Combatant and non-combatants are present.
  Combatants are wearing balaclavas and chest rigs.
. _Security Detail (Semi-Permissive, LowViz)_: Combatant and non-combatants are present.
  Combatants are using low visibility gear.

== Settings

* *Expected HVTs* - the amount of HVTs that will spawn in mission.
* *Expected resistance* - impacts the amount of enemies that will spawn in mission.
  The final Opposing Force count takes player count and this setting into account.
* *Respawn Cost* - the score value that is required for a respawn.
  Setting this value to 0 will basically allow for infinite respawns from the get-go, while setting it to 10000 will make it almost impossible to get at least one respawn.
* *Display Objective Messages* - whether objective messages should be displayed.
* *Display Objective Prompts* - whether objective world prompts should be displayed.
* *Display Score Messages* - whether score messages should be displayed.
* *Display Score Milestone Messages* - whether score milestone messages should be displayed.

== How to respawn

There are two ways to respawn:

. If your team achieved or surpassed the score necessary for a respawn before you died, then you can respawn using the '`Respawn`' option from the '`Out of Action`' death screen.
. Otherwise, or if you miss-clicked, you can respawn from the Ready Room as long as the round is In Progress.
  To do so, walk up to the Laptop placed on the desk next to the operation board and use it.

If somehow you ended up in the Spectating mode, press kbd:[F4] to go to the Ready Room.

Note: For the time being if you respawn from the Ready Room you will not be shown on the after action report.

== Additional notes

* In regular mode all HVTs don’t wear face masks or headgear. In semi-permissive all HVTs wear a black hat and a scarf.
* HVTs last known locations are marked on the map.
* Once an HVT is neutralized, but not yet confirmed eliminated, a world prompt will be displayed to guide the players to where they need to go to confirm the kill.
* Once all HVTs are eliminated a world prompt will appear in order to guide players to the extraction point.
* All world prompts will appear for 5 seconds every 15 seconds.
