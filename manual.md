# Ground Branch game mode creation

## Table of contents

### Lua scripts

Directory: [/GroundBranch/Content/GroundBranch/Lua](/GroundBranch/Content/GroundBranch/Lua)

Basics: [Lua basics](/GroundBranch/Content/GroundBranch/Lua/manual.md)

Lua scripts in this directory define the rules of game modes availble in Ground Branch.

### Localization tables

[Localization basics](/GroundBranch/Content/Localization/GroundBranch/manual.md)

Directory: [/GroundBranch/Content/Localization/GroundBranch](/GroundBranch/Content/Localization/GroundBranch)

This directory contains tables with text localizations in a `.csv` format. We'll be mostly interested
with the contents of the `/en/` folder as it contains tables with texts used by game modes. 
Also, as far as I know only English is supported at the moment.

### Mission files

Directory: [/GroundBranch/Content/GroundBranch/Mission/](/GroundBranch/Content/GroundBranch/Mission/)

Mission files contain all enemy, objectives etc. placement on specified maps. Mission files will be located in folders named based on the map they are assigned to. Don't try to edit theese with code editors. ;-)
