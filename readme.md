Below is more info how to work with this repo.

Note: Right now this project uses **gb-tools**, and game modes manifests (the *\*.gbm* files), for
packaging game modes into zip archives. More details about the **gb-tools** and
manifests can be found on the [**gb-tools** github page](https://github.com/gbgmc/gb-tools).
This will be replaced with a shell script that copies to "Documents/StagedMod" soon.
