# Ground Branch game modes

## Description

This repo contains custom game modes and missions for Ground Branch (and all 
other files neccessary for them to work).

Keep in mind the game is in early access, and this repo is a work in progress, 
everything is subject to change.

## Unofficial Ground Branch modding guide

Additionally, I'll note stuff that I learn about making game modes in a wiki. 
Maybe someone will find them useful. If you're interested in those start
[here](https://github.com/JakBaranowski/ground-branch-game-modes/wiki).

## Installation

To install any game mode follow this instructions:

1. Go to [releases page](https://github.com/JakBaranowski/ground-branch-game-modes/releases).
2. Download the game modes that you want to play.
3. Unpack the contents of the downloaded zip file to Ground Branch root directory
(by default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Ground Branch`)
4. If this is not the first game mode you are installing you might need to overwrite
some existing files. Don't worry no original game files will be overwritten.
5. You're ready to play the new game modes. GLHF! :-)

## Updating

Follow the same steps as in the installation guide and overwrite all existing files.

## Collaboration

You're more than welcome to clone, fork and send pull requests for this repository.
Below is more info how to set up the repo locally.

Git does not allow for cloning repositories to not empty directories, that's why you'll 
need to clone to any empty directory and then copy contents of that directory to Ground 
Branch root directory.

1. Open your prefered Git terminal (I recommend 
[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/))
2. Clone the repository:
    * HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/JakBaranowski/ground-branch-game-modes.git`
    * SSH: `git clone git@github.com:JakBaranowski/ground-branch-game-modes.git`
3. Copy files over from the cloned repository to Ground Branch root directory
   (by default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Ground Branch`).
