# Game modes for Ground Branch

Hi, hungry for some extra game modes? This repo (will) contain custom game modes and missions for Ground Branch (and all other files neccessary for them to work).

Additionally, I'll note stuff that I'll learn about making game modes in manuals
in folders "closest" to the matters discussed in the manual. Maybe someone will
find them useful. If you're interested in those start [here](manual.md).

Also the [.gitignore](.gitignore) is very useful if you want to "tinker" with Ground Branch game modes. ;-)

## How to install

This repository root folder is at the same level as the Ground Branch root folder. This means 
that all you need to do is copy the files from this reporsitory over to Ground Branch root folder.
More details below:

### If you use Git

I recommend using Git since it will make it easier to "update" files if needed. Also, you'll be able to contribute!

1. Navigate to the Ground Branch root directory 
(by default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Ground Branch`)
2. Open your prefered Git terminal (I recommend [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/))
3. Clone the repository:
    * HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/JakBaranowski/ground-branch-game-modes.git`
    * SSH: `git clone git@github.com:JakBaranowski/ground-branch-game-modes.git`

### What is git?

If you just want to download and play the game modes.

1. In the upper right corner of this website click the "Code" dropdown,
2. Click the "Download zip" button,
3. After the download is finished unpack the contents of `ground-branch-game-modes-main` folder from
within the `ground-branch-game-modes-main.zip` to your Ground Branch installation folder (by default:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Ground Branch`).
